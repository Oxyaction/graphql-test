      "description": "The Tesla Nano 60W TC Box Mod is not to be judged because of its size. This mod has an incredibly versatile chipset that allows it to perform a range of functions like dual temperature control functionality, and allows it to fire at resistances as low as 0.05ohms. The Nano has an internal 3600mAh Dual Cell LiPo Battery and was built with ventilation holes in its Zinc Alloy body. With an intuitive OLED display, and a suite of on-board protection, the Tesla Nano 60W offers a safe vaping experience.",
